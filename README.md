# Blockchain-CTF
A CTF-Based Exploration of Blockchain Vulnerabilities

# Blockchain Security CTF Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of Blockchain security, using a Capture The Flag (CTF) approach to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within Blockchain technology and Solidity Smart Contracts. Developed as a final project for a course on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology, this initiative aims to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical security exercises.

## Project Structure

### Theoretical Exploration
- **Integer Overflow**: Detailed understanding and mitigation strategies for integer overflow vulnerabilities in Solidity.
- **Misuse of `tx.origin`**: Exploration of the security implications of using `tx.origin` for authentication and its proper mitigation.

### Practical CTF Challenges
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Utilizes a cloud-based infrastructure leveraging AWS services to host Blockchain networks and CTF challenges.
- **Integer Overflow Challenge**: Step-by-step guide to deploying and exploiting integer overflow in a Smart Contract.
- **`tx.origin` Misuse Challenge**: Detailed walkthrough of deploying and exploiting a Smart Contract using the misuse of `tx.origin`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts.
- Basic understanding of AWS and cloud infrastructure.
- Experience with Solidity and Ethereum-based development tools like Remix and Etherscan.
